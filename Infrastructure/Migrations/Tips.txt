1. Set startup project to Tuitter-API
2. Open PMC (Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console)
3. In PMC set Default project to "src\Web\Tuitter-API"

4. Copy one or several of the following commands as needed.

4.1. Adding new migration (eg. after adding or updating some entity models) (you don't need to run this command when models are already up to date):
	Add-Migration <MigrationName> -Context TuitterContext -Project Infrastructure

4.2. Executing migration (eg. after updating models or when you just want to setup database for development):
	Update-Database

4.3. Remove last migration from code and database (rollback):
	Remove-Migration -Context TuitterContext -Project Infrastructure -Force

Important Note:
There seems to be some conflict between EntityFrameworkCore and EntityFramework6. The commands above are adapted for EntityFrameworkCore.

To ensure that they will be called on this library before each command, add 'EntityFrameworkCore\'.

For example:
	EntityFrameworkCore\Update-Database
